must reproduce on such copy the Apple copyright notice and any 
other proprietary legends that were on the original copy of the Apple

the other party reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions 
of this License.

5.    Government End Users.  If you are acquiring the Apple Software 
on behalf of any unit or agency of the United States Government, the 
following provisions apply.  The Government agrees:
    (i) if the Apple Software is supplied to the Department of Defense 
(DoD), the Apple Software is classified as "Commercial Computer

the Apple Software and its documentation as that term is defined in 
Clause 252.227-7013(c)(1) of the DFARS; and 
    (ii) if the Apple Software is supplied to any unit or agency of the 
United States Government other than DoD, the Government's rights in

Licensor(s) (for the purposes of provisions 7 and 8, Apple and 
Apple's Licensor(s) shall be collectively referred to as "Apple") 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

BE CORRECTED.  FURTHERMORE, APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE 
ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE 
USE OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN 
TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR 
OTHERWISE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE 
GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE 
SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE 
OF THIS WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE PROVE 
DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW 
THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE 
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

7.    Limitation of Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE, SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE

REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU.
In no event shall Apple's total liability to you for all damages, losses, 
and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) 
or otherwise) exceed the amount of $500.

by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States

residents.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds 
any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, 
that provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum 
extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the 
remainder of this License shall continue in full force and effect.

9.    Complete Agreement.  This License constitutes the entire 
agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Apple 
Software and related documentation, and supersedes all prior or 
contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, 
regarding such subject matter.  No amendment to or modification of 
this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly 
authorized representative of Apple.
