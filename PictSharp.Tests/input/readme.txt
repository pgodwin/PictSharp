Images from the Bmp Suite, v 2.7 2021-04-14.

BMP Suite itself is released under GPLv3 however the images are in the public domain.

They're here not to test Bitmap decoding, but different pixel formats :)

See below from the readme:

> Image files generated by this program are not covered by this license, and are
> in the public domain (except for the embedded ICC profiles).
